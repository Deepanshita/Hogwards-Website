           <h3>Goblet of fire!</h3>
           <p>“Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet. I will be drawing an Age Line around the Goblet of Fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall.Nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line…I wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly.The placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding, magical contract. There can be no change of heart once you have become a champion. Please be very sure, therefore, that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet.”<br>
